# Refactoring
To do this project, I split the initial function into four functions. Each of those functions are more understandable with the help of the guide I have written for them. Each of those functions, according to their names, now do certain things.
- UseInitialData
- GenerateStringCandidate
- CheckCandidateLength
- GenerateCandidate



## Writing Tests
In the test file, I have checked each of these functions separately in several tests.
I have used jest for testing. And I have grouped the tests in different suites.
